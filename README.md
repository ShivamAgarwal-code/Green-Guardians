# Green Guardian

# Inspiration
In today's world, adopting sustainable practices is more crucial than ever before. We understand that our consumption habits profoundly affect the environment. With our aim to create an eco-friendly marketplace, we hope to stand as a beacon of positive change.

# What it does
Our project is an eco-friendly marketplace designed to champion verified, environmentally-conscious products. We meticulously vet every seller by verifying their credentials and conducting thorough research to uphold our commitment to sustainability. From material sourcing and manufacturing to packaging and consumption, we ensure that the environment is considered at every step of the process.

# How we built it
This project was a collaborative effort that every team member actively contributed to. We utilized GitHub Teams to ensure a seamless exchange of ideas. While navigating the challenges of virtual collaboration, our proficiency in Java, coupled with our unwavering communication and dedication to eco-friendliness, empowered us to craft a website dedicated to environmental betterment.

# Challenges we ran into
Developing a full-stack website presents its own set of challenges. Even with our extensive programming experience, we encountered some initial hurdles, particularly with our database selection. We initially chose MongoDB, but soon recognized challenges related to API integration, transactions, schema design, and our familiarity with the platform. Consequently, we pivoted to Django. Its built-in functionalities for shopping carts, registration, admin panel and login made the process smoother for us, given our prior experience with the framework. However, this choice did come with certain limitations, especially concerning the variety of registration types.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The completion of our project, with its inherent simplicity, stands as our proudest achievement, especially considering our status as high school students and the limited time we had.

# What we learned
Throughout this project, our learning curve was steep. Together with our team members, we delved into the intricacies of Django. For some of us, it was also an enlightening experience to understand the inner workings of APIs and their implementation in full-stack development.

# What's next for Green Guardians
Should we choose to advance this project further, our aspiration is to collaborate with organizations and transform this initiative into a fully-fledged business.
